|| `\.` || Period character ||
|| `\\` || Backslash character ||
|| `&lt;` || Less than character (since it conflicts with XML markup) ||
|| `&quot;` || Double quote character `"` (escape not needed when using single-quotes to delimit attribute values) ||
|| `&apos;` || Single quote character `'` (escape not needed when using double-quotes to delimit attribute values) ||

|| `\d` || Digit [`0-9`] ||
|| `\D` || Non-digit ||
|| `\s` || Whitespace characters including space, tab, new line, form-feed, and carriage return [` \t\n\f\r`] ||
|| `\S` || Non-whitespace character ||
|| `\w` || Word character [`a-zA-Z_0-9`] ||
|| `\W` || Non-word character ||
|| `\b` || Word boundary (e.g., `\bScript\b` matches "Script" but not "Scripting" or "JavaScript".) ||
|| `\B` || Non-word boundary || 
|| `[ab\d]` || Character class matching a, b, or any digit ||
|| `[0-9a-f]` || Digits 0 through 9 and letters a through f (hyphen indicates a range) ||
|| `[a\-c]` || Characters a, c, and hyphen (within character classes, literal hyphens must be escaped) ||

A _character class_ defines a set of characters that are used to match text. Character classes are enclosed in brackets. For example, this character class matches the character a, b, or c: `[abc]`
