= Matching Constructs =

The following constructs an be used in the `match` element's `equals` and `except` attributes.

|| *Construct* || *Matches* ||
|| _x_ || Any literal character _x_ except for period, backslash, less than symbol, open bracket, and double quotes. [`.\[<"`] ||
|| `\.` || Period character (escaping not necessary within a character class) ||
|| `\\` || Backslash character ||
|| `\[` || Opening bracket ||
|| `&lt;` || Less than character (since it conflicts with XML markup) ||
|| `&quot;` || Double quote character `"` (escape not needed when using single-quotes to delimit attribute values) ||
|| `&apos;` || Single quote character `'` (escape not needed when using double-quotes to delimit attribute values) ||
|| `.` || Any character (when used outside of a character class). Matches line terminators only if the `dotMatchesLineBreaks` attribute is set to true. ||
|| `\d` || Digit [`0-9`] ||
|| `\D` || Non-digit ||
|| `\s` || Whitespace characters including space, tab, new line, form-feed, and carriage return [` \t\n\f\r`] ||
|| `\S` || Non-whitespace character ||
|| `\w` || Word character [`a-zA-Z_0-9`] ||
|| `\W` || Non-word character ||
|| `\b` || Word boundary anchor (e.g., `\bScript\b` matches "Script" but not "Scriptaculous" or "JavaScript".) ||
|| `\B` || Non-word boundary anchor (e.g., `\BScript` matches "JavaScript" but not "Script".) || 
|| `[ab\d]` || Character class matching _a_, _b_, or any digit ||
|| `[0-9a-f]` || Digits _0_ through _9_ and letters _a_ through _f_ (hyphen indicates a range) ||
|| `[a\-c]` || Characters _a_, _c_, and hyphen (within character classes, literal hyphens must be escaped) ||

A _character class_ defines a set of characters that are used to match text. Character classes are enclosed in brackets. For example, the character class `[abc]` matches the single character _a_, _b_, or _c_.
